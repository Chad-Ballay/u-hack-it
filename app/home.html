					The purpose of this site is to demonstrate some of the attack points, or "vulnerabilities",
					that a hacker might exploit to gain access to private information or otherwise compromise a website.

				<h3>Take Note!</h3>

					<li>
						DO NOT enter any real private or personal information - the site is desigend to be easily compromised!
					</li>
					<li>
						The examples given here are simple - crafted to make it easy to understand how the vulnerability is
						caused and how a hacker migh exploit it.  In reality, the vulnerabilities shown here would indicate very
						sloppy programming, and most sites now routinely block these kinds of gross vulnerabilities.  <br />
						In reatlity, vulnerabilites are often created in more subtle ways, and hackers are
						ever devloping more clever methods to exploit websites and wep apps - a developer must stay
						up-to-date on the latest types of vulnerabilities and best practices for blocking them.
